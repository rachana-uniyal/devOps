EXERCISE 4: Extract into Jenkins Shared Library
A colleague from another project tells you, they are building a similar Jenkins pipeline and they could use some of your logic. So you suggest creating a Jenkins Shared Library to make your Jenkinsfile code reusable and shareable.

Therefore, you do the following:

Extract all logic into Jenkins-shared-library with parameters and reference it in Jenkinsfile.

Solution:

Create a separate git repo for Jenkins Shared Library
Extract code withing the script blocks from increment version, Run tests, Build and Push docker image and commit version update to Jenkins Shared Library
Configure your Jenkinsfile to use the Jenkins Shared Library project
