EXERCISE 3: Manually deploy new Docker Image on server
After the pipeline has run successfully, you:

Manually deploy the new docker image on the droplet server.


Solution:

# ssh into your droplet server
ssh -i ~/id_rsa root@{server-ip-address}

# login to your docker hub registry
docker login

# pull and run the new docker image from registry
docker run -p 3000:3000 {docker-hub-id}/myapp:{image-name}
