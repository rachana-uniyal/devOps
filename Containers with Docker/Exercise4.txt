EXERCISE 4: Dockerize your Java Application
Now you are done with testing the application locally with Mysql database and want to deploy it on the server to make it accessible for others in the team, so they can edit information.

And since your DB and DB UI are running as docker containers, you want to make your app also run as a docker container. So you can all start them using 1 docker-compose file on the server. So you do the following:

Create Dockerfile for your java application


Solution:

FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
EXPOSE 8080
RUN mkdir /opt/app
COPY build/libs/bootcamp-java-mysql-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /opt/app
WORKDIR /opt/app
CMD ["java", "-jar", "bootcamp-java-mysql-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"]
