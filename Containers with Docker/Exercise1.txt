EXERCISE 1: Start Mysql container
First you want to test the application locally with mysql database. But you don't want install Mysql, you want to get started fast, so you start it as a docker container.

Start mysql container locally using the official Docker image. Set all needed environment variables.
Export all needed environment variables for your application for connecting with the database (check variable names inside the code)
Build jar file and start the application. Test access from browser. Make some change.

Solution:

# start mysql container using docker
docker run -p 3366:3306 \
--name mysql \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpass \
-e MYSQL_DATABASE=team-member-projects \
-e MYSQL_USER=admin \
-e MYSQL_PASSWORD=adminpass \
-d mysql mysqld --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password

# create java jar file
./gradlew build

# set env vars in Terminal for the java application (these will read in DatabaseConfig.java)
export DB_USER=admin
export DB_PWD=adminpass
export DB_SERVER=localhost
export DB_NAME=team-member-projects

# start java application
java -jar build/libs/bootcamp-java-mysql-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
