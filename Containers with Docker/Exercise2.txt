EXERCISE 2: Start Mysql GUI container
Now you have a database, you want to be able to see the database data using a UI tool, so you decide to deploy phpmyadmin. Again, you don't want to install it locally, so you want to start it also as a docker container.

Start phpmyadmin container using the official image.
Access your phpmyadmin from browser and test logging in to your Mysql database

Solution:

# start phpmyadmin container using the official image
docker run -p 8083:80 \
--name phpmyadmin \
--link mysql:db \
-d phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin

# access it in the browser on
localhost:8083

# login to phpmyadmin UI with either of 2 mysql user credentials:
* admin:adminpass
* root:rootpass
