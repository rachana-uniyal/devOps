EXERCISE 5: Build and push Java Application Docker Image
Now for you to be able to run your java app as a docker image on a remote server, it must be first hosted on a docker repository, so you can fetch it from there on the server. Therefore, you have to do the following:

Create docker hosted repository on Nexus
Build the image locally and push to the repository


Solution:

# create jar file - bootcamp-java-mysql-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
./gradlew build

# create docker image - {repo-name}/{image-name}:{image-tag}
docker build -t {repo-name}/java-app:1.0-SNAPSHOT .

# push docker to remote docker repo {repo-name}
docker push {repo-name}/java-app:1.0-SNAPSHOT
