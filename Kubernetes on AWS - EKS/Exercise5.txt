EXERCISE 5: Use ECR as Docker repository
Now your manager comes and tells you that all the projects in the company have containerized their applications, so there is no need for keeping and managing Nexus on the Droplet. Also since all projects have CI/CD there are hundreds of images pushed per day to Nexus repository and you need to manage the storage and cleanup policies to make space.

So, company wants to use ECR instead, again to have everything on 1 platform and also to let AWS manage the repository with storage, cleanups etc.

Therefore, you need to replace the docker repository in your pipeline with ECR


Solution:

# Create an ECR registry for your java-app image

# Locally, on your computer: Create a docker registry secret for ECR
DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER=your ECR registry server - "your-aws-id.dkr.ecr.your-ecr-region.amazonaws.com"
DOCKER_USER=your dockerID, same as for `docker login` - "AWS"
DOCKER_PASSWORD=your dockerhub pwd, same as for `docker login` - get using: "aws ecr get-login-password --region {ecr-region}"

kubectl create secret -n my-app docker-registry my-ecr-registry-key \
--docker-server=$DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER \
--docker-username=$DOCKER_USER \
--docker-password=$DOCKER_PASSWORD

# create 2 "secret-text" credentials for AWS access in Jenkins: 
- "jenkins_aws_access_key_id" for AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID 
- "jenkins_aws_secret_access_key" for AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY    

# Create 4 "secret-text" credentials for db-secret.yaml:
- id: "db_user", secret: "my-user"
- id: "db_pass", secret: "my-pass"
- id: "db_name", secret: "my-app-db"
- id: "db_root_pass", secret: "secret-root-pass"

# Set the correct values in Jenkins for following environment variables: 
- ECR_REPO_URL
- CLUSTER_REGION

# Create Jenkins pipeline using the Jenkinsfile in this branch, in the root folder
Make sure the paths to the k8s manifest files in the "deploy" stage of the Jenkinsfile are all correct!!
