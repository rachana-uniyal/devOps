EXERCISE 2: Deploy Mysql with 3 replicas
First of all, you want to deploy the mysql database.

Deploy Mysql database with 3 replicas and volumes for data persistence
To simplify the process you can use Helm for that.


Solution:

create file "mysql-chart-values-minikube.yaml"

architecture: replication
auth:
  rootPassword: secret-root-pass
  database: my-app-db
  username: my-user
  password: my-pass

secondary:
  # 1 primary and 2 secondary replicas
  replicaCount: 2
  persistence:
    storageClass: standard
    
    
    
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install my-release bitnami/mysql -f mysql-chart-values-minikube.yaml
