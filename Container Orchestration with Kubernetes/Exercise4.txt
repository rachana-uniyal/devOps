EXERCISE 4: Deploy phpmyadmin
As a next step you

deploy phpmyadmin to access Mysql UI.
For this deployment you just need 1 replica, since this is only for your own use,
so it doesn't have to be High Availability. A simple deployment.yaml file and internal service will be enough.


Solution:

Create file phpmyadmin.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: phpmyadmin
  labels:
    app: phpmyadmin
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: phpmyadmin
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: phpmyadmin
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: phpmyadmin
          image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin:5
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
          env:
            - name: PMA_HOST
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: db-config
                  key: db_server
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: db-secret
                  key: db_root_pwd
