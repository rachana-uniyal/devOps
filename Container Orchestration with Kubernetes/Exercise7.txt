EXERCISE 7: Port-forward for phpmyadmin
However, you don't want to expose the phpmyadmin for security reasons. So you configure port-forwarding for the service to access on localhost,
whenever you need it.

Configure port-forwarding for phpmyadmin

Solution:

kubectl port-forward svc/phpmyadmin-service 8081:8081
