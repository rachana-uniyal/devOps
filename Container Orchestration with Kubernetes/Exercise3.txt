EXERCISE 3: Deploy your Java Application with 3 replicas
Now you want to

deploy your Java application with 3 replicas.
With docker-compose, you were setting env_vars on server. In K8s there are own components for that, so

create ConfigMap and Secret with the values and reference them in the application deployment config file.


Solution:

# Create my-registry-key secret to pull image
DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER=docker.io
DOCKER_USER=your dockerID, same as for `docker login`
DOCKER_EMAIL=your dockerhub email, same as for `docker login`
DOCKER_PASSWORD=your dockerhub pwd, same as for `docker login`

kubectl create secret docker-registry my-registry-key \
--docker-server=$DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER \
--docker-username=$DOCKER_USER \
--docker-password=$DOCKER_PASSWORD \
--docker-email=$DOCKER_EMAIL


# Again from k8s-deployment folder, execute following commands
kubectl apply -f db-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f db-config.yaml
kubectl apply -f java-app.yaml
