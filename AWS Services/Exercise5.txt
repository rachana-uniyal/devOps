EXERCISE 5: SSH into the server and install Docker on it
Once the EC2 instance is created successfully, you want to prepare the server to run Docker containers. So you:

ssh into the server and
install Docker on it to run the dockerized application later



Solution:

ssh -i "WebServerKeyPair.pem" ec2-user@public-ip-address

# Install Docker, start docker service and allow ec2-user to run docker commands without sudo by adding it to docker group
sudo yum update -y && sudo yum install -y docker
sudo systemctl start docker 
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
