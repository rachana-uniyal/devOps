EXERCISE 6: Add docker-compose for deployment
First:

add docker-compose to your NodeJS application
The reason is you want to have the whole configuration for starting the docker container in a file,
in case you need to make changes to that, instead of a plain docker command with parameters. Also, in case you add a database later.


Solution:

docker-compose.yaml:

version: '3.8'
services:
    nodejs-app:
      image: ${IMAGE}
      ports:
        - 3000:3000
