EXERCISE 8: Configure access from browser (EC2 Security Group)

After executing the Jenkins pipeline successfully, the application is deployed, but you still can't access it from the browser. 
Again, you need to open the correct port on the server. For that you:

Configure EC2 security group to access your application from browser (using AWS CLI)

Solution:

#Open application's port 3000 in security group to make app accessible from browser

aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-id --protocol tcp --port 3000 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
