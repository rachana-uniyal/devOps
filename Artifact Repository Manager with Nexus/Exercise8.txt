EXERCISE 8: Download from Nexus and start application

Create new user for droplet server that has access to both repositories
On a digital ocean droplet, using Nexus Rest API, fetch the download URL info for the latest NodeJS app artifact
Execute a command to fetch the latest artifact itself with the download URL
Untar it and run on the server!

Solution:

# using Nexus Rest API, fetch the download URL info for the latest NodeJS app artifact
curl -u commonuser:common9898 -X GET 'http://165.22.213.185:8081/service/rest/v1/components?repository=my-npm'

#  Execute a command to fetch the latest artifact itself with the download URL
wget --http-user=team1 --http-password=Myteam@9090 http://165.22.213.185:8081/repository/my-npm/bootcamp-node-project/-/bootcamp-node-project-1.0.0.tgz

# Untar file
tar -xvf bootcamp-node-project-1.0.0.tgz

# run program
npm start
