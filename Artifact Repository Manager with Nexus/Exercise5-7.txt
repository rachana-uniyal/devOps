EXERCISE 5: Create maven hosted repository
For a Java application you:

create a new maven hosted repository


EXERCISE 6: Create user for team 2
You create a Nexus user for project 2 team to have access to this maven repository


EXERCISE 7: Build and publish jar file
You want to test that the project 2 user has the correct access configured and also upload the first version. So:

build and publish the jar file to the new repository using the team 2 user.

Solution:

# add following to build.gradle file

apply plugin: 'maven-publish'

publishing {
    publications{
        maven(MavenPublication){
            artifact("build/libs/my-app-$version"+".jar"){
                extension 'jar'
            }
        }
    }
    
    repositories{
        maven{
            name = 'nexus'
            url = 'http://165.22.213.185:8081/repository/maven-snapshots/'
            allowInsecureProtocol = true
            credentials{
                username = project.repoUser
                password = project.repoPassword
            }
        }

    }
}

# add ucer credentials to gradle.properties file.

# build jar file
./gradlew build

# pblish jar file to nexus repo
./gradlew publish
