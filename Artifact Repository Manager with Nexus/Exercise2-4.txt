EXERCISE 2: Create npm hosted repository
For a Node application you:

create a new npm hosted repository with a new blob store


EXERCISE 3: Create user for team 1
You create Nexus user for the project 1 team to have access to this npm repository


EXERCISE 4: Build and publish npm tar
You want to test that the project 1 user has correct access configured. So you:

build and publish a nodejs tar package to the npm repo

Solution:

# build npm tar
npm pack

# login to repo
npm login --registry=http://165.22.213.185:8081/repository/my-npm/


# publish repo
pm publish --registry=http://165.22.213.185:8081/repository/my-npm/
