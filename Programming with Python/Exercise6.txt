EXERCISE 6: Python Program 'Guessing Game'
Write a program that:

runs until the user guesses a number (hint: while loop)
generates a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9)
asks the user to guess the number
then prints a message to the user, whether they guessed too low, too high
if the user guesses the number right, print out YOU WON! and exit the program
Hint: Use the built-in random module to generate random numbers

Solution:

from random import randint

while True:
    number_to_guess = randint(1, 19)
    users_guess = int(input("Guess the number: "))

    if users_guess == number_to_guess:
        print("YOU WON!")
        break

    elif users_guess < number_to_guess:
        print("You guessed too low")

    elif users_guess > number_to_guess:
        print("You guessed too high")
