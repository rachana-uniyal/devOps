EXERCISE 1: Working with Lists
Using the following list:

my_list = [1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 22, 35, 52, 83]

Write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are higher than or equal 10.
Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements higher than or equal 10 from this list in it and print out this new list.
Ask the user for a number as input and print a list that contains only those elements from my_list that are higher than the number given by the user.


Solution:

# Print out elements higher than or equal 10
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 22, 35, 52, 83]
for number in my_list:
    if number >= 10:
        print(number)

# Make a new list with all elements higher than or equal 10 and print it out
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 22, 35, 52, 83]
my_new_list = []
for number in my_list:
    if number >= 10:
        my_new_list.append(number)
print(my_new_list)

# User input as a number and print a list that contains only those elements from my_list that are higher than the number given by the user.
user_input = input("Enter the number ")
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 22, 35, 52, 83]
my_new_list = []
for number in my_list:
    if number > int(user_input):
        my_new_list.append(number)
print(my_new_list)
