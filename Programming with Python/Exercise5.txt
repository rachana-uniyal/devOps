EXERCISE 5: Python Program 'Calculator'
Write a simple calculator program that:

takes user input of 2 numbers and operation to execute
handles following operations: plus, minus, multiply, divide
does proper user validation and give feedback: only numbers allowed
Keeps the Calculator program running until the user types “exit”
Keeps track of how many calculations the user has taken, and when the user exits the calculator program, prints out the number of calculations the user did
Concepts covered: working with different data types, conditionals, type conversion, user input, user input validation


Solution:

def calculator(number1, number2, operation):
    # from Python verson 3.10, you can use match-case
    if operation == "plus":
        print(number1 + number2)
    elif operation == "minus":
        print(number1 - number2)
    elif operation == "multiply":
        print(number1 * number2)
    elif operation == "divide":
        print(number1 / number2)
    

number_of_calculations_done = 0 
while True:
    number1 = input("Enter the first number: ")

    if number1 == "exit":
        print("exiting the program")
        print(f"you did {number_of_calculations_done} calculations")
        break

    number2 = input("Enter the second number: ")
    operation = input("What operation do you want to perform on these numbers (plus, minus, multiply, divide): ")

    valid_numbers = number1.isnumeric() and number2.isnumeric()
    valid_operation = operation == "plus" or operation == "minus" or operation == "multiply" or operation == "divide"
    if not valid_numbers:
        print("only numbers allowed") 
    elif not valid_operation:
        print("operation not supported")
    else:
        calculator(int(number1), int(number2), operation)
        number_of_calculations_done += 1
