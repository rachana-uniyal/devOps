EXERCISE 8: Working with Dates
Write a program that:

accepts user's birthday as input
and calculates how many days, hours and minutes are remaining till the birthday
prints out the result as a message to the user


Solution:

from datetime import datetime
birthday_string = input("Enter your birthday (example - 20/09/2000): ")

birthday_date = datetime.strptime(birthday_string, '%d/%m/%Y').date()
today = datetime.today()

difference_one = datetime(today.year, birthday_date.month, birthday_date.day)
difference_two = datetime(today.year + 1, birthday_date.month, birthday_date.day)

days_till_birthday = 0
if difference_one > today:
    # birthday this year
    days_till_birthday = difference_one - today
else:
    # birthday next year
    days_till_birthday = difference_two - today   

print(f"{days_till_birthday.days} days till your birthday")
