EXERCISE 10: Working with REST APIs
Write a program that:

connects to GitHub API
gets all the public repositories for a specific GitHub user
prints the name & URL of every project

Solution:

import requests

# replace with your own user 
user = "rachana"
response = requests.get(f"https://api.github.com/users/{user}/repos")
my_projects = response.json()

# print just the names and urls
for project in my_projects:
    print(f"Project Name: {project['name']}\nProject Url: {project['html_url']}\n")
