EXERCISE 3: Feature branch
Create a feature branch and change following:

Upgrade the logstash-logback-encoder version to 6.6
Add image to the index.html file (url: https://www.careeraddict.com/uploads/article/58721/illustration-group-people-team-meeting.jpg)
You are done with the changes. So:

Check your changes using "git diff" and
Commit them if everything is correct.
Note: There is a standard in your team to name commits with descriptive text.

Push your changes to your remote repository.

Solution:

# create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/changes

# in build.gradle file, line 18, locate the "logstash-logback-encoder" library 
# change version from '5.2' to '6.6'
compile group: 'net.logstash.logback', name: 'logstash-logback-encoder', version: '6.6'

# locate index.html file in src/main/webapp folder
# on line 9, add the image url with 
<img src="https://www.careeraddict.com/uploads/article/58721/illustration-group-people-team-meeting.jpg" width="" />

# check and commit  changes
git diff
git add .
git commit -m "upgraded logback library from 5.2 to 6.6 and added image url"

# pull remote changes and push your changes to remote
