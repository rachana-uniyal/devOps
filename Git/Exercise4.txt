EXERCISE 4 - Bugfix branch
You find out there is a bug in your project, so you need to fix it using a new bugfix branch:

Create a new bugfix branch
Fix the spelling error in Application.java file
You are done with the changes. So:

Check your changes using "git diff" and
Commit them if everything is correct.
Push your changes to your remote repository.

Solution:

# create bugfix branch
git checkout -b bugfix/changes

# in Application.java file in src/main/java/com, line 22, fix the spelling error
log.info("Java app started");

# check and commit  changes
git diff
git add .
git commit -m "Fix spelling error"

# pull remote changes and push your changes to remote
git pull 
git push
