EXERCISE 7: Revert commit
Still on the bugfix branch. You also noticed a spelling mistake in the index.html file, so you want to fix that in the same branch.

Fix the spelling mistake and commit the fix
You also want to update the image.

So also change the image url (src) in a separate commit.
You are done with the changes:

Push both commits to the remote repository.


Your team members tell you the previous image was the correct one, so you want to undo it. But since you already pushed to remote, you must revert the change.

Revert the last commit and push your changes to remote repository

Solution:


# on bugfix branch

# locate index.html in src/main/webapp, line 11 & fix spelling error
<li>Sarah - Full stack devloper</li>

# commit change locally
git add .
git commit -m "Fix spelling error"

# locate index.html in src/main/webapp, line 11 & set image url
<img src="https://3kcz333h8wih3px3rh3vhfv3-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/effective-meetings.jpg" width="" />

# commit change locally
git add .
git commit -m "Set image url"

# push both commits to remote
git push

# revert last commit and push the revertion into remote repo
git revert HEAD
git push
