EXERCISE 9: Merge
This time you want to merge your branch directly into master without merge request. So:

merge your bugfix branch into master using git CLI (Hint: master branch must be up-to-date before the merge)
Being on the master branch now. Push your merge commit to remote repository

Solution:

# merge bugfix branch into master
git checkout master
git merge bugfix/changes
