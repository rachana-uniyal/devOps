EXERCISE 6: Fix merge conflict
You are on the bugfix branch. You notice the logger library version is old, so:

Update it to version 6.2 (Change the same location in bugfix branch)
Some time went by since you opened your bugfix branch, so you want the up-to-date master state to avoid major conflicts.

Merge the master branch in your bugfix branch - fix the merge conflict!


Solution:

# switch to bugfix branch
git checkout bugfix/changes

# in build.gradle file, line 18, locate the "logstash-logback-encoder" library 
# change version from '5.2' to '6.2'
compile group: 'net.logstash.logback', name: 'logstash-logback-encoder', version: '6.2'

# commit change locally
git add .
git commit -m "upgrade logger library version"

# bring bugfix branch uptodate with master branch. Alternatively do the merge from Gitlab UI
git merge master

# you will get a merge conflict here for build.gradle file, like 18, logback library version 

# fix merge conflict and when done check the state
git status

# if all fixed, you can commit and push the merge into your bugfix branch
git push
