EXERCISE 5: Merge request
You are done with the feature, now it needs to be tested and deployed. So:

Merge your feature branch into master (using a merge request)

Solution:

# merge feature branch into master. Alternatively do the merge from Gitlab UI
git checkout master
git merge feature/changes 

# push the merge to remote master
git push
