Extend the script (Exercise 6) to check after running the application that the application has successfully started 
and prints out the application's running process and the port where it's listening. 






# display that nodejs process is running
ps aux | grep node | grep -v grep

# display that nodejs is running on port 3000
netstat -ltnp | grep :3000
