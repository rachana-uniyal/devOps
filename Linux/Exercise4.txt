Extend the previous script (Exercise3) to ask for a user input for sorting the processes output either by memory or CPU consumption, 
and print the sorted list.

Solution

#!/bin/bash

echo -n "Would you like to sort the processes output by memory or CPU? (m/c) "
read sortby

if [ "$sortby" = "m" ]
then
    ps aux --sort -rss | grep -i `whoami`
elif [ "$sortby" = "c" ]
then
    ps aux --sort -%cpu | grep -i `whoami`
else
    echo "No input provided. Exiting"
fi
